Spring Social Facebook 1.0.0 (September 8, 2011)
================================================
 Misc:
  * Updated FacebookTemplate to match changes in AbstractOAuth2ApiBinding.

Spring Social Facebook 1.0.0.RC3 (August 25, 2011)
==================================================
Bug Fixes
  * Treat false responses from Facebook's Graph API as errors indicating
    insufficient privileges. This fixes a deserialization problem when
    trying to deserialize "false" as an object. (SOCIALFB-18)
  * Handle "Feed action request limit reached" errors by throwing
    RateLimitExceededException. (SOCIALFB-19)

Improvements
  * New sample demonstrating how to use Spring Social in a Facebook
    Canvas application. (SOCIALFB-20)

Spring Social Facebook 1.0.0 RC2 (July 26, 2011)
================================================
Improvements
  * Changed GraphApi.fetchConnections() to more intuitively work with 
    list element type rather than a list wrapper. (SOCIALFB-9)
  * Handle duplicate status errors from Facebook by thrown a
    DuplicateStatusException. (SOCIALFB-12)
  * Added offset and limit parameters to many API methods to support
    paging through results. (SOCIALFB-14)

Bug Fixes
  * Added SwfPost and MusicPost types and change post deserialization
    to fall back to generic Post type when the type is unrecognized.
    (SOCIALFB-2)
  * FacebookErrorHandler now does default error handling first and
    only reads the body of the response if it gets past the default
    handling to avoid IOExceptions when using SimpleClientHttpRequestFactory.
    (SOCIALFB-13)

Spring Social Facebook 1.0.0 RC1 (June 22, 2011)
================================================
  * Spring Social Facebook extracted into a standalone project that can
    progress and release independent of Spring Social releases.
  * More API bindings:
    * Upload photos and videos
    * Fan pages, including posting to a page's feed as the page
      administrator.

Refer to Spring Social's changelog for a history of the Facebook module
prior to it being extracted into its own project.
